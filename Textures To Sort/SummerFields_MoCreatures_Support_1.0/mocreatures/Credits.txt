Credits list:

Dr. Zhark for the wonderful Mo' Creatures mod.
LithiumSound for making SummerFields, the original texture pack that this is based on.
DiamondSquid for the Ogres and Wraiths.

The rest of the textures currently available in this download were created by me, CuddleWoozle. 

Some are very close to the default textures that come with Mo' Creatures, such as the Ostriches.  I felt that the Ostriches were a pretty good fit already and I only changed their eyes to match the rest of the SummerFields animals.

To Use:

Just drop the folders in this .zip file into your current SummerFields texture pack .zip file.
